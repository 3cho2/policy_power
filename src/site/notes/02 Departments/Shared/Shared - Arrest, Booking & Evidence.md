server: Policy Power
type: shared_policy

## Arrest (minimum)
- Clearly state reason/charges during the arrest process.
- Maintain scene control under IC until stable.

## Custody & Transport (baseline)
- Arresting unit maintains custody until formal handoff is completed.
Required language:
- “`Transferring custody of <name> to <unit/agency>.`”
- “`<unit/agency> has custody.`”

## Booking locations & responsibility (Policy Power)
> [!note]
> Each agency has its own jurisdictional jail/booking. Units may take prisoners to any jail, but it is advised the primary/arresting unit uses their own agency jail whenever practical.

### Allowed exceptions (any-jail transport)
- Distance/time advantage
- Scene safety/resource limits
- Facility restrictions (closure/capacity/outage)
- IC/supervisor assignment

### When a non-arresting unit transports (required)
> [!warning]
> If a non-arresting unit transports/books, they must complete **intake documentation** and **supplemental notes**.

Supplemental notes must include:
- Time custody received + time delivered
- Facility used
- Prisoner condition (injuries/complaints)
- Property handling
- Any incidents during transport/intake

### Reports responsibility
- Primary report: arresting/primary unit unless reassigned
- Supplemental: transport unit if they transported + receiving facility intake notes
- Evidence stays with arresting unit unless formally transferred

## Evidence handling (minimum)
- Evidence tied to case/report number
- Document: who collected + what + where stored
- Chain-of-custody language:
  - “`Transferring evidence to <unit/agency>.`”
  - “`<unit/agency> received evidence.`”
