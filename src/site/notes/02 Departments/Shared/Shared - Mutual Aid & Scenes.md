# 02 Departments/Shared/Shared - Mutual Aid & Scenes

server: Policy Power
type: shared_policy

## Scene command rule (Policy Power)
> [!note]
> **IC defaults to First On Scene (FOS).**  
> **If/when a unit from the proper jurisdiction arrives, IC transfers to that jurisdiction’s first-arriving unit** (unless an exception applies).

### Jurisdiction guide (baseline)
- LSPD: City jurisdiction (Los Santos)
- SSCE: County/unincorporated (Sandy Shores region)
- SAHP: Highways/statewide traffic; coordinated lead when pursuit/highway-primary

## IC Transfer Procedure (standard)
1. Jurisdiction unit: “`<Unit> on scene, jurisdictional.`”
2. Current IC: “`Copy. Transferring IC to <Unit>.`”
3. New IC: “`<Unit> has IC.`”
4. IC updates priorities.

## Exceptions (FOS keeps IC temporarily)
- Immediate life threat / rescue in progress
- Active tactical operation where handoff would cause confusion
- Jurisdiction unit declines IC
- Command staff assumes IC by announcement

## Mutual aid request flow
1. location + need + urgency
2. dispatch assigns
3. responders check in and follow IC direction

## Unified command
Use when cross-border or long-duration:
- Primary IC + agency liaisons
- One comms plan (primary + TAC)
