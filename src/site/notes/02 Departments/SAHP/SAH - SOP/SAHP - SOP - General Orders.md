# SAHP - SOP - General Orders

## 1) Mission
SAHP exists to provide professional highway/statewide traffic enforcement, incident response, and coordinated pursuit support while maintaining RP quality, fairness, and public safety.

## 2) Authority and professionalism
- Members represent Policy Power and SAHP; maintain calm, respectful conduct.
- OOC disputes are not handled in-scene. Complete the scene, then use staff processes.

## 3) Duty status (minimum)
- On-duty members identify availability on primary radio.
- Use TAC for active incidents when directed by IC/supervisor.

## 4) Chain of command (server-defined)
> [!todo]
> Insert your ranks and who has supervisor authority.

Minimum standard:
- Follow lawful supervisor instructions during operations.
- If no supervisor is present, the highest-ranking on-duty SAHP member acts as supervisor until relieved.

## 5) Cross-department alignment (required)
SAHP follows shared Policy Power standards:
- IC defaults to First On Scene, then transfers to jurisdiction first-arrival.
- Pursuits: initiating jurisdiction keeps lead until SAHP arrives and transfer is confirmed.
- PIT/spikes require Supervisor Approval.
- Booking: each dept has its own jail; any jail allowed; primary unit advised to use their own; transport unit must do intake + supplemental notes.

## 6) Reporting standard (required)
All SAHP reports use:
- `PP-YYYYMMDD-SAHP-####` where `####` is continuous per SAHP.
