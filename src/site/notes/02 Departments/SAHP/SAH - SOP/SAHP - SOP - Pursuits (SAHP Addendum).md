# SAHP - SOP - Pursuits (SAHP Addendum)

## 1) Alignment statement
This addendum does not replace shared pursuit policy. Shared policy is authoritative.

## 2) Assuming lead (SAHP arrival)
SAHP may assume lead only when transfer is completed:
1. SAHP requests lead
2. Current lead transfers
3. SAHP confirms lead
4. Dispatch updates lead + comms plan

## 3) Supervisor Approval (required)
- PIT and spikes require approval before use.
- If no supervisor is available: no PIT/spikes unless imminent threat to life; document afterward.

## 4) After-action expectations
For significant pursuits:
- Ensure reports are completed
- If needed, complete an AAR
- Capture any policy/training/dev follow-ups
