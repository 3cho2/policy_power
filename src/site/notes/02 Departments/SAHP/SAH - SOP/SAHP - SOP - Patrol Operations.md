# SAHP - SOP - Patrol Operations

## 1) Primary responsibilities
- Highway and major roadway patrol
- Traffic enforcement and collision response
- Highway incident mitigation (closures, hazards)
- Pursuit support/coordination (as SAHP arrives and assumes lead by transfer)

## 2) Call handling baseline
- Acknowledge dispatch/requests promptly.
- If you cannot respond, state why and your next availability.
- For active incidents, move comms to TAC per shared comms plan.

## 3) Scene command behavior
- First On Scene is IC until relieved.
- If the incident is within another jurisdiction, transfer IC to that jurisdiction’s first-arriving unit when they arrive.
- SAHP may remain as traffic control, perimeter, pursuit, or transport support as directed.

## 4) Highway scene safety (RP baseline)
- Establish a safe perimeter and keep lanes controlled when practical.
- Prioritize medical response and hazard mitigation.
- Avoid unnecessary escalation; keep scenes realistic.
