# SAHP - SOP - Radio & Comms (SAHP Addendum)

## 1) Goal
Keep comms clean, realistic, and easy to follow during high-tempo scenes.

## 2) Channel use (minimum)
- Primary: routine traffic, availability, simple updates
- TAC: active incidents requiring coordination
- Pursuit channel (if used): pursuit-only comms

## 3) Comms discipline
- Short, factual updates
- Avoid radio clutter during pursuits/scenes
- Plain language unless your server explicitly allows codes
