# SAHP - SOP - Traffic Enforcement

## 1) Purpose
Provide consistent, fair, and RP-friendly traffic enforcement.

## 2) Stop initiation (baseline)
- Clearly articulate the reason for the stop in-character.
- Choose a safer stop location when practical.
- Maintain professionalism; de-escalate when possible.

## 3) Stop structure (RP-friendly)
- Greeting and reason for stop
- Request documents/ID (per your server rules)
- Clear instructions to driver
- Decision: warning/citation/arrest (when justified)

## 4) High-risk stops (server-defined)
> [!todo]
> Define what qualifies and when to call supervisor/backup.

Minimum:
- Request backup when risk is credible.
- Use TAC if scene becomes active.

## 5) Impaired driving (server-defined)
> [!todo]
> Define tests/procedures your server uses.

Minimum:
- Keep it realistic and paced.
- If arrest occurs, follow shared custody/booking rules.

## 6) Documentation
When a report is required, use case format:
- `PP-YYYYMMDD-SAHP-####` (continuous SAHP ####)
