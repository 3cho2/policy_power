# 1) Purpose and scope
## 1.1 Purpose
- Establish consistent standards across all departments and members
- Enable clean cross-department collaboration
- Keep policy, training, and development changes transparent and trackable

## 1.2 Scope
Applies to Owners/Admin, Dev Team, SAHP/LSPD/SSCE, and CIV.

---

# 2) Roles and authority
## 2.1 Owners
- Final authority on policy, staffing, and server direction
- Final appeal authority unless delegated

## 2.2 Admin Team
- Enforces rules and handles moderation/support
- Manages incidents and appeals workflow

## 2.3 Department Command (SAHP/LSPD/SSCE)
- Manages department SOPs, training standards, and internal discipline
- Ensures department SOPs do not conflict with shared standards

## 2.4 Dev Team
- Implements technical changes using the change/release process
- Maintains stability/performance priorities

---

# 3) Communication and collaboration
> [!note]
> Two “all-member” spaces: **Community** (everyone, including CIV) and **Inter-Department Collaboration** (department coordination).

## 3.1 Community
- Announcements, General Q&A, Suggestions & Feedback, Member Resources, CIV Roster

## 3.2 Inter-Department Collaboration
- Joint Ops Board, Cross-Dept Training Calendar, Interop Issues & Fixes

## 3.3 Expectations
- Keep comms short and factual
- During incidents: follow radio/comms standards and IC direction
- Disputes happen after the scene using staff processes

---

# 4) Member standards (all members)
## 4.1 Conduct
- No harassment/discrimination/targeted hostility
- No OOC arguing in active scenes; resolve afterward

## 4.2 RP baseline
- No metagaming/powergaming/exploiting
- Value life; realistic risk and consequences
- Follow IC for structure and pacing

---

# 5) Department overview and jurisdictions
## 5.1 SAHP
- Highways/statewide traffic, highway pursuits coordination, statewide support

## 5.2 LSPD
- Los Santos city limits, urban patrol, rapid response, city investigations

## 5.3 SSCE (Sheriff-style county)
- County/unincorporated (Sandy Shores region), rural response, warrants, county booking for SSCE jurisdiction (if used)

---

# 6) Inter-department SOP (shared)
> [!warning]
> Applies whenever: multiple departments respond, scene crosses jurisdictions, or mutual aid is requested.

## 6.1 Scene command (IC) and mutual aid
> [!note]
> **IC defaults to First On Scene (FOS).**  
> **If/when a unit from the proper jurisdiction arrives, IC transfers to that jurisdiction’s first-arriving unit**, unless an exception applies.

**IC transfer procedure**
1. “`<Unit> on scene, jurisdictional.`”
2. “`Copy. Transferring IC to <Unit>.`”
3. “`<Unit> has IC.`”
4. IC updates dispatch/responders.

**Exceptions**
- Immediate life threat / rescue
- Active tactical operation where handoff causes confusion
- Jurisdiction unit declines IC
- Command staff assumes IC by announcement

**Mutual aid flow**
1. location + need + urgency
2. dispatch assigns
3. responders check in and follow IC

## 6.2 Radio and comms (minimum)
- Primary for routine
- TAC for active incidents
- Pursuit channel (if separate)
- Plain language unless server allows codes

## 6.3 Pursuits (ownership + tactics)
> [!note]
> If a pursuit starts in a jurisdiction (ex: Los Santos), **the initiating jurisdiction keeps lead/IC** even if it transitions to highway **until SAHP arrives and a transfer is completed**.

**Lead transfer to SAHP**
1. “`SAHP <Unit> on pursuit, requesting lead.`”
2. “`Copy. Transferring lead to SAHP <Unit>.`”
3. “`SAHP <Unit> has lead.`”
4. Dispatch updates lead + comms plan.

**Pursuit Supervisor**
- On-duty supervisor of lead agency
- If none: highest-ranking unit is temporary supervisor

> [!warning]
> **PIT and Spikes require Supervisor Approval**.

**Approval format**
- “`Request PIT authorization.`” / “`Request spikes authorization at <location>.`”
- “`Approved/Denied.`”
- If approved: confirm who/when/where + retrieval plan for spikes

**No supervisor**
- No PIT/spikes unless imminent threat to life; document in AAR/supp notes

## 6.4 Arrest, booking, custody, and evidence
**Custody language required**
- “`Transferring custody of <name> to <unit/agency>.`”
- “`<unit/agency> has custody.`”

**Booking locations**
> [!note]
> Each agency has its own jurisdiction jail/booking. Units may use any jail, but it is advised the arresting/primary unit books at their own agency jail when practical.

**Non-arresting transport requirement**
> [!warning]
> If a non-arresting unit transports/books, they must complete **intake documentation** and **supplemental notes**.

**Reports responsibility**
- Primary report: arresting/primary unit unless reassigned
- Supplemental: transport unit if they transported + receiving facility intake notes
- Evidence stays with arresting unit unless formally transferred (chain-of-custody)

## 6.5 Reports and case numbers (combination + continuous)
> [!note]
> Shared required core + department optional add-ons. `####` is **continuous per department** (does not reset daily).

**Required core:** `PP-YYYYMMDD-<DEPT>-####`  
**Optional:** `-<TYPE>-<UNIT>`

Examples:
- `PP-20260217-LSPD-0142-FELONY-ADAM-21`
- `PP-20260217-SSCE-0068-WARRANT-SS-310`

---

# 9) Development and change management
- Bugs and features are documented with templates
- Changes follow: change request → test → deploy → release notes

---

# 10) Meetings and documentation
- Meeting notes: attendees, decisions, action items
- AAR after major pursuits, joint operations, significant incidents

---

# 11) Templates (copy blocks)
Bug / Feature / Change / Incident / AAR blocks are stored in Templates notes.

---

# 12) Appendix
## 12.1 Case number counters (manual, if no CAD/MDT)
- SAHP next ####: 0001
- LSPD next ####: 0001
- SSCE next ####: 0001
- CIV next ####: 0001 (only if CIV files reports)
- ADM next ####: 0001 (only if admins file internal cases)

Rule: assign next, then increment immediately.
